# PSoC 6 MCU: Ramping LED Using Smart I/O

This example uses a PWM resource and Smart I/O™ in PSoC 6 MCU to implement a ramping LED, where an LED gradually cycles through increasing and decreasing brightness levels. There is no CPU usage except for the initialization of PWM and Smart I/O.

## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note**: The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the Code Example

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the Quick Panel (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**).

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the **Library Manager** to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, right-click the application name from the Project Workspace window in the IDE, and select **ModusToolbox** > **Library Manager**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example.

4. Optionally, update the **Application Name:** and **Location** fields with the application name and local path where the application is created.

5. Click **Create** and complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder. 

    On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, navigate to the modus-shell directory (*{ModusToolbox install directory}/tools_\<version>/modus-shell*) and run *Cygwin.bat*.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow the instructions from the CLI section to download or clone the repository, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the USB connector.

3. Program the board.

   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox**:

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**.


   - **Using CLI**:

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

      **Note**:  Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.  

3. Using a jumper wire, connect the Smart I/O output pin to the User LED pin on the board (See Table 1). Observe the ramping effect on the User LED.

    **Table 1. LED Pin Connection**

    |    Board           |  Smart I/O Output Pin   |  LED Pin    |  
    | -------------------|------------|-------------|
    | CY8CKIT-062-BLE    |    P9[1]   | P13[7]      |
    | CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT|    P9[1]   | P13[7]      |
    | CY8CPROTO-062-4343W|    P9[1]   | P13[7]      |    
    | CY8CPROTO-063-BLE  |    P9[1]   | P6[3]       |
    | CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W|   P9[1]   |  P11[1]       | 
    | CY8CKIT-062S2-43012|    A9      | R.LED       |   
    | CYW9P62S1-43438EVB-01|    A9      | R.LED       | 
    | CYW9P62S1-43012EVB-01|    IO11 **    | R.LED       |

    **Note:**<br> ** By default IO11 of the CYW9P62S1-43012EVB-01 board is not connected to the MCU. Remove **R29** and populate **R152** with 0 ohm resistor to connect to the MCU pin. Please refer to the board schematics for more details. 

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

## Design and Implementation

This design consists of a PWM resource and a Smart I/O resource, both creating square waves of slightly different frequencies. These square waves are routed through an exclusive-OR (XOR) gate within the Smart I/O resource, yielding a signal with a gradually changing duty cycle. The rate of change is proportional to the difference between the output square wave frequencies.
The signal is then output to I/O1 of the Smart I/O port 9. Driving LED with this signal results in a "ramping" effect, where the LED gradually get brighter and dimmer alternately.

The PWM is driven by a 10-kHz clock with a period of 399 counts and a compare value of 200 counts. This gives a 50 percent duty cycle square wave with a 40-ms period. The Smart I/O is clocked at 99 Hz using a divided clock sourced from CLK_PERI. This input clock is divided by 4 using the lookup tables (LUTs) of the Smart I/O resource to produce a square wave with a 40.4 ms period.

To generate a square wave signal with a time period close to 40 ms, a 99-Hz clock is divided by 4 using a synchronous sequential circuit, which is realized using the LUTs of the Smart I/O resource.

To implement a divide-by-4 sequential circuit, consider the state transition values shown in Table 2.

**Table 2. State Transition Table for a Divide-by-4 Sequential Circuit**

|    Clock |  Q0(n)|  Q1(n)|Q0(n+1)|Q1(n+1)|  D0 |  D1 |
| ---------|------ |------ | ------| ------| ----| ----|
| &uparrow;|  0    |   0   |   1   |  1    |  1  |  1  |
| &uparrow;|  1    |   1   |   0   |  1    |  0  |  1  |
| &uparrow;|  0    |   1   |   1   |  0    |  1  |  0  |
| &uparrow;|  1    |   0   |   0   |  0    |  0  |  0  |

From this state transition table, you can observe that Q0 is half the frequency of Clk_SmartIO and Q1 is 1/4th frequency of Clk_SmartIO. This sequential logic can be implemented using the LUTs of the Smart I/O resource.

Figure 1 shows the implementation of this logic using LUT 2 and LUT 3. In addition, the divided clock is XORed with the PWM output using LUT 1 to generate a signal with the duty cycle gradually increasing and decreasing over time. The output of LUT 1 is driven to I/O 1 output.
